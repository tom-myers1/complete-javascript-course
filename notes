* setting up external .js file
* definition
  * js is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented language
  * low memory, simple syntax and features
  * used across OS's
  * based on objects

* client side vs server side (node.js)
* tons of frameworks/libraries like React and Angular based on js - master js, master (well at least use) them all

* 3 core web technologies
  * html
  * css
  * js

  html = page content (words, images, buttons etc) ,<nouns eg paragraph>
  css = style (font, size, colour etc) <adjectives eg paragraph is red>
  js = what happens and when <verbs eg hide paragraph>


* primitive data-types
  * number - floating point for decimal and integers (instead of separate like int, bigint, dec etc etc)
  * string - characters for text
  * boolean - logical data - true or false
  * undefined - not yet got a value (var t;)
  * null - as in null

dynamic typing - variables are automatically given data-types, if you assign to different type it will auto switch types

in console and editor variables show up different colours - help understand what is what

* comments
  * // inline
  * /*
    multiple lines
    */


*** naming convention for variables
  * always give meaningful names
  * lower case first word upper case second (camel case)
*** naming rules
  * cannot start with or contain number or special character except $ or _
  * cannot use reserved words (function, delete, if etc)


  *********** line 32 script.js

  age is automatically converted from number to string to output in console
  works same for bool and undefined

  line 41 - change age from number to string (donâ€™t have to "var age", just "age" as its already a variable)


* console.log = logs to console
* alert = pop up box (page keeps loading until hit ok)
* prompt = get data from input box (again page keeps loading...)

**************** operators

* maths = + - * /
* logical = > < == !=
* typeof = shows data-type of variable

*** operator precedence
look at http://codingheroes.io/resources and click operator precedence
show order of execution!! very important

maths happens before logical ie x + y > z even if you write z > x + y
assignment ( = ) is (almost) last
use good maths ie (x + y) / 3
() have higher precedence
can assign multiple variables to same thing x = y = 2-36;
